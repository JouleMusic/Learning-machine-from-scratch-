# Choosing the right estimator

Often the hardest part of solving a machine learning problem can be finding the right estimator for the job.

Different estimators are better suited for different types of data and different problems.

The flowchart below is designed to give users a bit of a rough guide on how to approach problems with regard to which estimators to try on your data.

Click on any estimator in the chart below to see its documentation.

## 模型参数
交叉验证（cross validation）
> 交叉验证集做参数/模型选择

> 测试集只做模型效果评估
